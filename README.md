# Cohort 2.0 Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Cohort 2.0** repository from **Sheryians Coding School**!  
This repository contains all the projects and assignments I completed as part of the **Job Ready AI Powered Cohort 2.0** program.

Each task folder contains the project code, assets, and (if deployed) a live demo link.

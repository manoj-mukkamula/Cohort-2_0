A **static landing page** recreated using **HTML and CSS**, inspired by **Apple's official homepage**.

### 📘 Overview

This project replicates the clean, product-focused design of Apple's website.
The page includes a fixed navigation bar, large hero panels (Diwali promo, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air), and a responsive $2 \times 3$ product tile grid.
Although not yet fully responsive, it demonstrates advanced layout and visual hierarchy using only HTML and CSS.
